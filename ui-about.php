            <p class="a-col-d">Most people will think that their anti-virus is just giving false positives during an installation of a pirated OS but the truth is that 92% of pirated OS really do contain malware.</p>
            <p>Most of these malware are the most dangerous: Rootkits, which continuously send keystrokes, pictures, videos (when you have a webcam), usernames, passwords, financial details and other data they can take advantage of. These malware severely slow down your PC by using its CPU, RAM and running hidden programs.</p>
            <p>“Cracking” an OS is a complicated process involving alteration of the system’s core files and core registry files. It also alters the way your computer connects to the servers. These alterations adversely hinder the way your PC communicates with the OS thru your drivers, making your PC up to 40% slower than usual.
